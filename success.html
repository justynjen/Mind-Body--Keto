    description: ‚ÄúI have worked with Nicole professionally on a range of projects since we met over 10 years ago and was delighted when she announced that she was not only working with her existing clients but had now extended her service offering to include weight loss coaching and was taking on new clients.This was a huge hurray for me as I am based in Sydney, Australia and her online/remote coaching service was perfect for my heavy travel schedule and the fact I was residing in a different hemisphere. Witnessing first hand Nicole‚Äôs own personal weight loss success and the proven results she had with her long term clients I did not hesitate to hire Nicole to help me overcome a lifelong addiction to sugar. I have several rare food allergies where eating fruit and vegetables literally can kill me therefore I was particularly impressed by Nicole‚Äôs ability to handle even the toughest of my dietary restrictions‚Äîeffortlessly. She has achieved what no other coach or health professional has, but it seemed to come perfectly naturally to her. Being a single mum with two small children in addition to running my own business where I am constantly travelling plus severe food allergies I would have thought it was impossible to take control of my weight and health. Yet with Nicole‚Äôs unwavering support I not only kicked my sugar addiction I found a love and confidence with food, my body and my life!‚Äù

    description: I was hungry ALL THE TIME. I knew I was overweight and looking back, I realize it was my coping mechanism to hide from having to deal with other people. Staying in with a pizza and a glass of wine was much easier than going out with friends. But my doctor was concerned that I was heading towards diabetes - a disease that is very difficult to manage but easy to prevent. I had done weight loss attempts many times, but none of them were sustainable. I had a rough few years where I spent my time trying to make other people happy (and was thinner), and it hurt my self esteem. When I first started keto, my entire world felt like it was turned upside down. I had made the commitment to change my foods but EVERYTHING in my house was carbs and sugars! I cried at the grocery store looking at stuff that I hadn't eaten in years and now I only had limited items to pick from. It was overwhelming to have to begin cooking again for myself and making responsible choices. My first real encounter with Nicole was calling her from the grocery store in tears (I'm on the east coast and she is in CA). Nicole was calm and patient and the 1st week she said, "get a whole cooked chicken and fresh broccoli. Bake the broccoli with some seasonings and cheese. Eat as much as you want." I did it and ate almost the entire chicken my 1st day! Nicole actually listens to my issues. She is very understanding of my general lifestyle and does not "push" me to do something I am not comfortable with. This had to be a slow process in my mind in order for me to know that this is the life I am choosing for the rest of my life. I feel I can be honest with her and I have allowed her positive suggestions to sink in and have actually incorporated them at a pace that will keep me doing it moving forward. I learn more about myself from our conversations so I can cope better for the next time. I don't want my life to go back to the way I was. I have COMPLETELY altered the way I look at food. I can still enjoy myself and those food items that gave me comfort, now just make me feel bad. I like eating lots of veggies, protein and cheese! I plan to keep this going forever. I like myself more now and feel like being outside of my own comfort zone more often. Overall , I cannot thank Nicole enough for doing this with me. I know for sure that I would never have done this on my own. I needed that "Kick" to change my diet. I've also gotten a much better understanding about the food compositions and how to look at foods before buying them.
