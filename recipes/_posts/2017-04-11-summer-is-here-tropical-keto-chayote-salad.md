Summer. Is. Officially. HERE!! YAY! And with it, super warm weather all over the place. I don’t know about you, but there’s nothing better to eat on a hot day than a crisp, cool, and hydrating salad. Enter this tropical chayote squash salad, smashing together Southeast Asian cuisine with Mexican/Caribbean style ingredients!

&nbsp;

I discovered chayote (also known as christophine, pipinola, choko, mirliton, and vegetable pear among others) while working as a yacht chef sailing in the Caribbean. I wondered what the heck these weird-looking produce items even WERE when I first saw them, and I was seeing them everywhere. Finally, after many sightings but no tastings, I decided to bite the bullet and do that thing that chefs do, ordering a “Christophine Farcie avec Crabe” in a tiny waterfront restaurant in the still pretty rustic &Icirc;les de Saintes, a Guadeloupe dependent archipelago in the French Antilles.

&nbsp;

In the event you do not speak French, “Christophine Farcie avec Crabe” means “Crab Stuffed Chayote”. And in the event you have never tried French food, it’s all pretty amazing. I was hooked immediately and introduced the dish into my tropical cheffing repertoire. And then I went to Thailand.

&nbsp;

Chayote – which are members of the same family as cucumbers, melons, and squash –&nbsp; are mild, juicy vegetables. They are so apple-y when cooked that McDonalds was accused of using them in their apple pies to save moolah (disproved, btw…)! Stuffed with crab and breadcrumbs back when I didn’t know I had a gluten intolerance – AWESOME. And one day, when I discovered that the green papaya for the salad I’d learned to make in Thailand was no longer green, I turned to them in hopes that they could save me.

&nbsp;

AND I WAS RIGHT! Turns out they taste a bit like a cross of a Granny Smith apple and a cucumber when raw – a PERFECT substitution when making Som Tam. Before you could say “green papaya salad”, I had made the switch full time because I simply liked the crunch better.

&nbsp;

Now that they’re turning up at the Northern California farmers’ markets again, I am DOWN to bring back Caribbean-style with Cali-style ingredients!
