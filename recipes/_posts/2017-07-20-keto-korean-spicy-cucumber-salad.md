COOL AS A CUCUMBER (SALAD). Crunchy, juicy, cool – and one of my fave low-carb summer veggies! They’re like the watermelon of the vegetable world – and that shouldn’t be surprising since they’re, like, COUSINS and both part of the plant family Cucurbitaceae. Yeah, I don’t know how to say that EITHER, but why not share a fun fact?! But I digress!<br><br>This keto Korean spicy cucumber salad is SO refreshing, packing a slightly spicy punch while cooling you off and hydrating you at the same time. I made this to go with my Keto Chicken Bulgogi from a few posts ago – and the two paired like soulmates. UNGH!!! As in, OH MY WORD SO FAB! And it’s ridiculously easy and quick to make – I did it while I was marinating the chicken.

### <br>Keto Spicy Cucumber Salad

Serves 4

* 1 large cucumber, English or regular
* 1 shallot or ¼ c red onion, sliced very thin
* Pinch coarse sea salt, kosher salt, or Himalayan salt
* 1 teaspoon gochugaru (Korean chili flakes) – crushed red pepper will work if you can’t find them
* 2 teaspoons white or rice vinegar
* 1 teaspoon Keto sweetener (I used a Monkfruit & Stevia blend)
* 1 clove garlic, minced
* Sesame seeds for garnish

### INSTRUCTIONS

<br>First, peel the cucumber. Cut lengthwise and use a spoon to scoop out the seeds. (This will help it not get too watery too quickly! I hate soggy cukes…)

Slice into thin, half-moon-like pieces and place into a small serving bowl. Toss with the salt and thinly sliced onion and set aside.<br><br>In a medium mixing bowl, combine the next 4 ingredients and mix into a loose paste. The size of the bowl may seem excessive, but now you’re going to tip the sliced cucumber & onion mixture in and toss well to coat! Transfer back to the serving bowl and chill for at least 15 minutes to let the flavors develop. This is a great time to stir-fry your chicken! Once you’re ready to serve, sprinkle liberally with sesame seeds and enjoy!
