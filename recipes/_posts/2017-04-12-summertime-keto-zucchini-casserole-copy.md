Summer-summer-summer-time! Summertime means zucchini-time in my li’l brain. My family had a big, completely unruly and untended vegetable garden that produced 8 billion zucchini no matter HOW much we ignored it! I used to have to wade through thistles and weeds to pick the zukes and heavenly-smelling tomatoes among other veggies. It wasn’t fun – AT ALL – but the payoff was delicious. And that’s all that matters, right?

My mom could transform zucchini into as many dishes as Bubba could name shrimp ones in Forrest Gump, and this was before the world even TALKED about zoodles… Zucchini bread, zucchini frittata, stewed zucchini, zucchini cake, zucchini fritters, and my all time favorite – ZUCCHINI CASSEROLE!

Creamy, cheesy, half-quiche and half-bread, this casserole was the stuff my dreams were made of. The Bisquick and caramelized onions that it was originally made of imparted a slightly sweet flavor, but definitely kept it from being low-carb. Well, my darlings – I FIXED THAT!

I can’t wait until you try this for yourselves – please let me know how it comes out in the comments!

Summer is marked by zucchini for me, and I just had a craving for the cheesy, bready, but almost quiche-like zucchini casserole of my childhood! Once you have this easy-to-make-delight, I’ll bet it will be in YOUR repertoire, too.

### INGREDIENTS

●	3 c thinly sliced zucchini●	8 eggs●	¼ c melted salted butter●	1 + ½ c shredded cheddar cheese (I used goat cheddar, because why not?)●	¼ c grated Romano (Parmesan will do, too)●	⅓ c coconut flour●	½ teaspoon baking powder●	Salt & Pepper●	8 x 8 baking dish or something of similar volume

### INSTRUCTIONS

1. Preheat oven to 375ºF.
2. In a small mixing bowl, whisk together coconut flour, baking powder, pinch salt & pepper until well combined.
3. In a larger mixing bowl, whisk together eggs, slightly-cooled butter, and grated Romano cheese.
4. Transfer the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients and whisk well. The mixture will start to thicken.
5. Fold in the zucchini and 1 cup of the shredded cheddar.
6. Line an 8 x 8 baking dish with parchment paper and fill with the zucchini mixture.
7. Sprinkle top with remaining half cup of cheddar cheese and dust with black pepper.
8. Bake for about 20 minutes, until the casserole is pretty firm to the touch and the cheese on top has turned golden brown in patches.
9. Remove from the oven and allow to cool for at least 15 minutes if you want somewhat cohesive pieces. Transferring the entire parchment paper & casserole combo to a wire cooling rack will speed up the process.
10. Cut into 16 serving pieces and enjoy! Garnish with a little extra salt & grated cheese if you so desire!
