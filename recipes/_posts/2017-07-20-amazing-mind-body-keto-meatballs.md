Are you ready to do a happy dance? Because you're about to read the easiest and most delicious keto meatball recipe ever. They're fluffy! They're juicy! They're Paleo! They hold together without feeling as dense as rocks! Can I getta WOOT WOOT?! All that jazz and they are a mere 1.9g carbs per serving of 5 meatballs, with 21g of fat and 20g of protein. HOLLAAAAAAA…

Add 1/4 c of no-sugar-added marinara sauce (5g net carbs) and 100g zucchini noodles (2g net carbs) and you have a super filling, #nutritious meal for under 10 carbs. Did I mention ridiculously yummy, too? SPAGHETTI NIGHT IS BACK!

 

### AMAZING MIND BODY KETO MEATBALLS

 

#####  

### INGREDIENTS

 

* 1/2 lb 85% lean ground beef (I use organic AND grass fed)
* 1/2 lb ground pork (again, organic where possible)
* 1oz/~30g pork rinds/cracklings/scratchings
* 1oz/~30g/1/4 c almond flour
* 2 teaspoons Italian seasoning
* Big pinch salt
* 1 Tablespoon Omnivore Sicilia or tomato paste
* 1 egg

 

### INSTRUCTIONS

 

1. Preheat oven to 375ºF.
2. Combine pork rinds, almond flour, dried herbs, and salt in a food processor and pulse until a homogenous "breadcrumb" mixture is achieved.
3. Transfer to mixing bowl with beef, pork, egg, and tomato paste/Sicilia. NOTE: you can use one type of meat here, or more types - just keep the total to 1lb. Mix well until there are no dry pockets.
4. Using a 1oz portion scoop or simply a tablespoon, divide the meat into ~20 pieces and place on parchment paper lined tray. Roll between your hands to form smooth balls.
5. Bake for 10 - 15 minutes, until firm yet springy to the touch.
6. Remove from oven, top with sauce, and enjoy!

Alternately, you can simmer these babies overnight in low-sugar sauce like Rao's for an even deeper flavor experience. Super yummy!
