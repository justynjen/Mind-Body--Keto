Aioli is a staple sauce all over the world, creamy and garlicky with a hint of lemon. Whether used as a sandwich spread, topper on freshly prepared meats, or dip for potatoes of any kind, it is a fantastic addition to your repertoire. And we call it Cheater’s Aioli because we use any kind of already prepared mayonnaise as a base and whip all the rich flavor right into it!

Cheater’s Aioli takes minutes to make, and you can make it your own by adding the fresh herb of your choice. Pro-tip – add basil to make an AMAZING compliment to seared tuna as well as turkey sandwiches! And use in place of regular mayonnaise in traditional savory recipes.
