CAKE CAKE CAKE CAKE... Cake that’s so good and so well-balanced, full of protein and not too sweet, it’s ANYTIME CAKE. Breakfast cake! Lunch cake! Teatime cake! Post-workout cake! Dinner or dessert cake! And personally, I like mine with a tall glass of unsweetened @califiafarms Almond milk, just sayin’.

I created this keto chocolate & hazelnut torta (Italian for cake) to bring to a dinner party hosted by my favorite Italiana last night. I've said it before, but when an Italian invites you to a party, ALWAYS SAY YES. I can pretty much assure you that the food, wine, and company will ALWAYS be amazing!

Anyhow, it came out fluffy, moist, and only lightly sweet. Perfect for a very simple dessert, but could also be stacked into one frickin' awesome layer cake! This version is made with butter, and I will be testing out some other alternatives to create a dairy free option, too.

Recipe type: dessert

Cuisine: European, American, Californian, Vegetarian

Serves: 16 regular or 8 large slices

&nbsp;

### INGREDIENTS

&nbsp;

* 1/4 c almond flour
* 1/4 c hazelnut flour
* 1/4 c cocoa powder
* 1/8 c coconut flour
* 1/2 c granulated Swerve/erythritol
* 2 teaspoons baking powder
* 6 eggs
* 1 c butter, melted (I used salted - you could use unsalted with a pinch of salt)
* 1 Tablespoon hazelnut oil
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* For garnish:
* Confectioners/powdered Swerve/erythritol
* Chopped toasted hazelnuts

&nbsp;

### INSTRUCTIONS

&nbsp;

1. Set your oven to 350&ordm;F and line the bottom of a 9 - 10" cake pan with parchment paper.
2. Combine all of the dry ingredients in a medium mixing bowl and whisk to combine thoroughly.
3. In another bowl, crack and beat the eggs and then whisk in the slightly cooled melted butter, vanilla extract, and hazelnut oil.
4. Add the wet to the dry and blend well with a whisk so that no dry pockets remain. The batter will start to thicken up almost immediately.
5. Transfer to the prepared cake pan and bake for 20 - 25 minutes, until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.
6. Cool completely, transfer to a serving plate, and garnish with powdered Swerve shaken through a fine-mesh sieve.
7. Top with chopped hazelnuts, and serve!
