CHEESE AND RICE!!! Hahaha – that has always been one of my favorite blasphemous swear-replacers, but it’s also a really tasty dish. I mean, any combination of carbs and cheese really tickles most tastebuds – until you bite the bullet and start “living la vida low-carb”, that is! Thank goodness for cauliflower rice – especially the salsa-infused kind from my last recipe –  because it really is a wonderful vehicle for creamy, cheesy, deliciousness if that is something that you can include in your diet. Add an egg and we are enjoying the easy Mexican-inspired individual breakfast casseroles of the titular fame!

Seriously, the day I tested my Mexican cauliflower rice recipe, I fell in love. I devoured some with chicken in coconut sauce. I ate some it on its own. Late at night, I mixed some with cheese, sour cream, and mayonnaise and baked it with more cheese on top because I am a chef, I am Keto, and I am on vacation. And as the last bits of that final dish were being joyfully consumed, I knew that I would have to add an egg the next day and have it as a breakfast casserole.

 

Each one of these super-filling little guys delivers 12.5 grams of protein and 14.2 grams of fat with only 3.3 net carbs. Why WOULDN’T you have all of the ingredients on hand and make these in the amount of time it takes to make a cup of coffee!? And they are so tasty!

This happy little casserole is perfect for a hearty Keto breakfast without much effort if you are starting with leftover salsa-infused cauliflower rice. It’s actually a great side dish if you leave out the egg, too, though you cut the fat and protein almost in half. However you decide to do it, I promise you’re going to LOVE it!

Recipe type: Breakfast, Snack

Cuisine: Healthy, Keto, Low Carb, Californian

Serves: 2 servings

 

### INGREDIENTS

 

* 1 cup prepared Mexican cauliflower rice
* ½ c shredded cheese, divided (cheddar, Monterey Jack, Mexican blend)
* 2 Tablespoons sour cream (creme fraiche is even fattier and tastier!)
* 2 large eggs
* Additional equipment: 2 6 – 8oz ramekins

 

### INSTRUCTIONS

 

* Heat your oven to 400ºF/205ºC.
* In a small mixing bowl, combine the cauliflower rice, ¼ cup of the shredded cheese, and sour cream.
* Divide the mixture between the two ramekins and create a well in the center.
* Crack an egg into each of the wells.
* Top the casseroles with the remaining ¼ cup of cheese.
* Bake in the oven for 10 – 15 minutes, until the cheese is melted. 10 minutes will give you a softer yolk, but it will not be runny.
* Top with a little extra salsa and dig in!

A little pro-tip because I really love runny yolks: to get the same nutritional profile but have a yummy, runny self-saucing dish, bake the breakfast casserole without the egg. Instead, poach a couple while the baking is finishing. It’s a little extra work, but if you’re an egg fiend like me…

 

### HOW-TO IN PICTURES:

 

Pic 1: Combine the casserole ingredients in a mixing bowl

Pic 2: Divide between two ramekins and make a well to crack the egg into.

Pic 3: Top each egg with 2 Tablespoons of cheese.

Pic 4: Once both are topped with cheese, they are ready to bake at 400ºF/205ºC for 10 – 15 minutes.

Pic 5: Remove from the oven when the cheese is melted and the edges are a little golden.

Pic 6: Top with a little extra salsa and enjoy. I like to add a little salad and fresh avocado for an even greater nutrient boost!

 

### LITTLE POTS OF YUM

 

This recipe can be easily multiplied, and I’m pretty sure that everybody you know is going to love it. I’ll be working on a dairy-free & Paleo version with cashew sour cream and zucchini cheese very soon, because you know what? I want everybody I know to taste the yumminess in some way, shape, or form. It’s just how I casser-roll!

What do you think, my healthy and delicious fam? Can you see yourselves serving this up at a casual brunch, or making it part of your regular morning routine? Tell me more in the comments – I would love to hear!
