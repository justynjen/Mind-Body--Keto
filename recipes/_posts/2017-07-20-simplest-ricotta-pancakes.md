FOR FATHER’S DAY! You may have noticed over the last few days that I have deep passion for all these &nbsp;keto breakfast foods. Bagels and pancakes and eggies, OH MY! And all with a side of berries, bacon, and sausage? Can I get a HECK YEAH up in heah?

These simple ricotta pancakes have 4 ingredients and came out with fluffy insides and crispy edges. I kinda want to make MORE MORE MORE, but I’m out of the ricotta, dang it! And I KNOW the iterations are endless – lemon zest, blueberries, shaved chocolate/chocolate chips.

Anyhoo – let’s get down to brass tacks. This is the basic recipe that I need to test again (repeatedly, deliciously), but if you want these in your face ASAP, this is basically what I did:

Recipe type:&nbsp;

Cuisine:&nbsp;

Serves: &nbsp;~10 ¼c measured pancakes

&nbsp;

### INGREDIENTS

&nbsp;

* 6 eggs
* 8oz/1 cup ricotta, full fat of course!
* ½ c almond flour
* Splash vanilla extract
* Butter for greasing the pan

&nbsp;

### INSTRUCTIONS

&nbsp;

1. Whip up the first 4 ingredients in a bowl until the mixture is thick and looks like yellow cake batter.
2. Heat a non-stick frying pan over medium-high heat until a drop of water sizzles and disappears. I just ran the end of a stick of butter over the pan to grease it up, then dropped batter with a 1/4c measure around the pan, allowing for space between the pancakes.
3. Cook for ~2 minutes until the tops start to look dry, then flip using a silicone spatula. BE GENTLE; they ARE a little delicate, which is how they’re fluffy and crispy at the same time! After 30 seconds cooking on the 2nd side, transfer to a warm plate and continue the process until the batter is gone.

We ate them with fresh berries, more butter, and @lakantosweetener Monkfruit Maple Flavored Syrup, plus buckets of coffee, homemade sausage patties, and lots of bacon. SO GOOD! Sigh – I love being Keto…
