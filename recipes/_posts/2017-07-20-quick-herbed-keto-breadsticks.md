On Sundays, I TOTALLY get the “brunchies”… You know, the uncontrollable desire to eat an even BETTER and more elaborated breakfast than normal and find a friend or two to share it with? You already KNOW my breakfast game is on point, but this keto chef always has a few tricks up her sleeve!

&nbsp;

Today, as I’d invited a vegetarian/pescatarian pal to dine with me for a good old-fashioned catch-up, I replaced breakfast meats with some beautiful wild smoked salmon & cream cheese to be served on these ridiculicious (ridiculously delicious!) Herbed Keto Breadsticks that I dreamed up.

&nbsp;

Paired with easy garlicky vegan hash and my fave sesame fried eggs, this brunch was SUCH a yummy feast!

* 1/2 teaspoon [onion powder](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005P0TJ4I/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B005P0TJ4I&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=bychefnicole-20&amp;linkId=23feee1202441407a22b3628269bece2)
* 4 eggs
* 4 Tablespoons butter, ghee, or [coconut oil](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06Y4SZ3DZ/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B06Y4SZ3DZ&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=bychefnicole-20&amp;linkId=ebd14bc17f223e1d43825020fa487ada), melted (I used salted butter)
* 1/8 teaspoon salt if not using salted butter

&nbsp;

### INSTRUCTIONS

&nbsp;

1. Preheat oven to 375&ordm;F.
2. Combine dry ingredients in a bowl and whisk to blend well.
3. Add the eggs and butter and whisk again until the batter is smooth and there are no dry bits left.
4. Pour into a parchment-paper lined 8” x 8” baking dish. (I actually used an 8x12 tray because it’s what was on hand, and I like the thickness of the sticks. 8x8 will come out a bit more cornbread-style).
5. Bake for 15 - 20 minutes until the bottom is golden and the top is dry and begins to crack.
6. Remove from oven, cool for a couple of minutes, and cut into pieces. Enjoy! .
