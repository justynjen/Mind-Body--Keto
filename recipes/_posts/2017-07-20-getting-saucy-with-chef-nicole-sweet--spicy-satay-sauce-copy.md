Everybody loves satay sauce. Sweet and nutty with a little kick – (kinda like Chef Nicole herself!) – it’s also very easy to modify to accommodate most common allergies or dietary restrictions. In the gluten free, dairy free recipe below, you will find options listed to make your satay sauce keto and/or Paleo.

Try this sauce for dipping seasoned satay skewers, but also tossed through noodles, zoodles, or even a salad! Fantastic with beef, chicken, pork, shrimp, and vegetables.
