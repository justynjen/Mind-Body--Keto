Feeling just a little tropical today and craving the flavors of warmer latitudes and far-off lands, so I decided to bring the tropics TO me via the kitchen! All those years cooking my way through the Caribbean definitely gave me a taste for coconut shrimp, and don't you think it's about time for a crispy keto version?!? I tested 4 versions of these before getting 'em just right, so I know you're going to be licking your fingers, whether you dip them in cilantro-walnut pesto or NOT.

So delicious, quick, and easy with only five ingredients in the recipe, YOU NEED MORE ISLAND TIME IN YOUR LIFE!&nbsp;

Recipe type: sauce, dip, condiment

Cuisine: European, American, Californian, Vegetarian

Serves: 2

&nbsp;

### INGREDIENTS

&nbsp;

* 8oz Shrimp, I used 21-25 size
* 1/4 c/15g desiccated UNSWEETENED coconut
* 1/8 c/20g coconut flour
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1/2 tsp sweetener, preferably confectioners style Swerve, but a packet of Splenda or stevia would do
* 1 egg
* 2-4 Tablespoons coconut oil (for frying)

&nbsp;

### INSTRUCTIONS

&nbsp;

1. Pat shrimp dry with paper towel.
2. In a small bowl, crack the egg and whisk until uniform.
3. Place shrimp in the egg wash and toss to coat.
4. Combine dry ingredients in another small bowl and stir well with a fork to distribute evenly.
5. Melt coconut oil in a frying pan over high heat. Once it is melted and shimmering, dredge shrimp in dry mixture until completely covered and place in hot oil. Repeat with more shrimp until the pan is being fully utilized still with 1/2" between shrimp - you don't want to overcrowd.
6. Fry until golden on bottom, then flip and repeat process, removing fully golden shrimp and placing on a paper towel lined plate to remove excess oil. Once all of the shrimp are done, serve and enjoy! YUM!!
