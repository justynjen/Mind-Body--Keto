On keto, we ditch the carb laden buns and breads and generally replace with nature’s favorite wrapping paper: lettuce!

It’s tasty, it’s easy, and unfortunately - it can also be messy! We end up with juices and sauces all over our fingers and eating surface, or even eat over the sink to keep things clean. With a little parchment paper, wax paper, or even foil, you can avoid this and have a tidy little package to pop into your purse or lunch bag. Moms all over the world used to know how to fix this until we got so used to chucking everything into “sandwich bags”. So I’m going to give you a little lesson on how to do it:

&nbsp;

#### HOW TO MAKE YOUR OWN PORTABLE LETTUCE-WRAPPED SANDWICH

&nbsp;

##### INSTRUCTIONS:

&nbsp;

1. Start with a piece of wrapping paper 4x larger than your unwich. Place the lettuce leaves, layered, in the middle and pop the toppings in the center.

2. Top with another lettuce leaf.

3. Roll the extra leaf towards the center to create your package.

4. Fold in one side of the wrapper and hold down securely, like you’re wrapping a present.

5. Do the same with the other side. You should have a 3-layered rectangle of paper now.

6. Bring the unfilled ends together.

7. Fold those ends together and roll towards the unwich. This will make the whole package tighter.

8. Flip over onto the seam and cut into halves.

9. You can either eat right then, or pop into another bag to consume later. Either way, you now have two easily grabbable halves to nibble from, pushing the paper back as you go!

Super easy, and it makes eating everything - from a cashew cheese-stuffed burger with all the toppings to a chicken salad sandwich - SO much more enjoyable and clean! WOOHOO!
