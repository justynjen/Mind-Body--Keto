Cuisine:&nbsp;

Serves: 6 pieces

&nbsp;

### INGREDIENTS

&nbsp;

* 1 1/4 c shredded mozzarella
* 3/4 c almond flour
* 1 Tablespoon baking powder
* 2 Tablespoons cream cheese
* 1 egg
* 1 Tablespoon finely chopped rosemary
* Pinch hot red pepper flakes (optional)
* Pinch black pepper

### INSTRUCTIONS

&nbsp;

1. Preheat oven to 375 F. Chuck the mozzarella, almond meal, and baking powder into a microwave safe bowl and stir with a fork until well combined. Add the cream cheese and microwave for 1 minute. Remove from micro, stir well, and pop back in for another 30 seconds.
2. Once it’s done, stir with that fork again to release some of the heat and then mix in the egg and chopped rosemary until it’s well-combined.
3. Turn the dough into a large piece of parchment paper that you can fold over (so there are two layers of paper sandwiching the dough, and roll into a rectangular shape no less than 1/2” thick. This dough is so easy to shape, but it doesn’t have to be perfect anyway!
4. Tear off the top layer of paper when you’re done and place on a baking tray. Poke your fingers into the dough to make focaccia indentations, then sprinkle with chilli flakes and black pepper.&nbsp;
5. Pop it into the oven for 12 minutes or so until it’s golden brown. Remove, cool, cut and eat dipped in your favorite olive oil, or maybe with some fresh-from-the-garden heirloom tomatoes! YUM!&nbsp;
