I call this cheater’s chimichurri because we skip the hand-chopping usually involved. We instead use a blender or food processor to whip it up, and the flavor and texture results are fantastic!

&nbsp;

Chimichurri keeps in the fridge for 1 – 2 weeks and pairs well with just about everything, from simple chicken breasts to steak to shrimp.

Traditional chimichurri requires all the same ingredients – but finely chopped by hand. Make it easier by using a blender or food processor.
