Author: Nicole Poirier

Recipe type: sauce, dip, condiment

Cuisine: European, American, Californian, Vegetarian

Serves: 1 cup

&nbsp;

### INGREDIENTS

&nbsp;

* 2 Tbsp butter
* 8oz sliced mushrooms
* 1/2 cup cream
* 1 large leek, thinly sliced

&nbsp;

### INSTRUCTIONS

&nbsp;

1. Melt the butter over medium-high heat.
2. Add the sliced mushrooms and one thinly sliced large leek.
3. Sprinkle with salt and saut&eacute;, allowing the mushrooms to get a little golden and leeks to soften completely. The salt will help both release their juices and prevent from burning as they cook!
4. Finally, add 1/2 cup cream and turn heat down to low, simmering until it thickens, about 8-10 minutes. SO. DANG. RIDICULICIOUS!!&nbsp;

And FYI - for any of you with amine and salicylate intolerances out there, this is a perfect meal for low chem keto - because everybody deserves to find their best health deliciously. ðŸ’–
