It’s Saturday, which means lazy breakfast in my book! And by “lazy”, I mean “let the oven do the work”. I don’t want to stand over a pan today. I just want to enjoy my coffee with my hair a mess and have a keto snickety snack when an alarm goes off. My Parmesan Eggy Bites allow me to do just that – and really, enjoy them for days if I feel like it. Or maybe I’ll eat them all today! The world is my eggy bite!

Recipe type:&nbsp;

Cuisine:&nbsp;

Serves: 12

&nbsp;

### INGREDIENTS

&nbsp;

* 12 eggs
* ½ c heavy cream
* 1 c shredded parmesan
* 2 Tbsp chopped herbs (I used chives, thyme, and basil)
* Pinch salt
* Cracked black pepper

&nbsp;

### INSTRUCTIONS

&nbsp;

\*\*NOTE: These are best done in a silicone muffin tray placed on a baking sheet.&nbsp;

1. Preheat oven to 375&ordm;F. Spray your muffin wells with the oil of your choice just to ensure easy-slippy-outage.
2. In a large bowl, combine all the ingredients. Distribute evenly between the muffin wells.
3. Pop in the oven and bake for ~20 minutes, until they have risen well out of the wells and are firm yet springy to the touch.
4. Remove from the oven, cool slightly, and enjoy!
