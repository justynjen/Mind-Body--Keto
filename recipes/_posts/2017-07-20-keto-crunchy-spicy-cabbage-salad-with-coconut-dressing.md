SALAD SO GOOD, IT MIGHT MAKE YOU CRY... It's crunchy, it's spicy, it's salty, IT'S GOT PORK RINDS! This is my favorite keto salad to date, and I literally dreamed about it last night since I am on the egg fast train. I LOVE veggies, and texture, and tropical-tasting, spiced up, coconut drizzled anything.

This salad comes together really quickly and one cabbage is enough to feed about 20 people. It's CRAZY! 1/8 of this recipe has 25g fat, 9 net carbs, and 30g protein. Happy dance, much?
