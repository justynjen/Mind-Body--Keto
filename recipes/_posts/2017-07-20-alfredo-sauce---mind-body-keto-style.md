SAUCE IT UP. Anybody who knows me knows I’m all about the sauces! And I love that eating keto invited those previously forbidden cream sauces back into our lives - I missed rich and decadent Alfredo so much! All that said, I don’t really need 16 servings available to me at the same time because I will just about DRINK that ish, and even if it’s low carb - I don’t need THAT much fat in one sitting. Plus, cream carbs do add up. So I just whipped up this little recipe for 2 servings with what I had laying around the house.

End result - 1/4 cup serving drizzled over 1c blanched broccoli & 8oz seasoned baked chicken breast. SO YUMMY!
