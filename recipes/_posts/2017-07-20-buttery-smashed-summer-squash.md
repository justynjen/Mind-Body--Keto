COOL AS A CUCUMBER (SALAD). Crunchy, juicy, cool – and one of my fave low-carb summer veggies! They’re like the watermelon of the vegetable world – and that shouldn’t be surprising since they’re, like, COUSINS and both part of the plant family Cucurbitaceae. Yeah, I don’t know how to say that EITHER, but why not share a fun fact?! But I digress!<br><br>This keto Korean spicy cucumber salad is SO refreshing, packing a slightly spicy punch while cooling you off and hydrating you at the same time. I made this to go with my Keto Chicken Bulgogi from a few posts ago – and the two paired like soulmates. UNGH!!! As in, OH MY WORD SO FAB! And it’s ridiculously easy and quick to make – I did it while I was marinating the chicken.

### <br>Keto Spicy Cucumber Salad

Serves 4

* 1 large cucumber, English or regular
* 1 shallot or ¼ c red onion, sliced very thin
* Pinch coarse sea salt, kosher salt, or Himalayan salt
* 1 teaspoon gochugaru (Korean chili flakes) – crushed red pepper will work if you can’t find them
* 2 teaspoons white or rice vinegar
* 1 teaspoon Keto sweetener (I used a Monkfruit & Stevia blend)
* 1 clove garlic, minced
* Sesame seeds for garnish

&nbsp;

### INSTRUCTIONS

<br>First, peel the cucumber. Cut lengthwise and use a spoon to scoop out the seeds. (This will help it not get too watery too quickly! I hate soggy cukes…)

Slice into thin, half-moon-like pieces and place into a small serving bowl. Toss with the salt and thinly sliced onion and set aside.<br><br>In a medium mixing bowl, combine the next 4 ingredients and mix into a loose paste. The size of the bowl may seem excessive, but now you’re going to tip the sliced cucumber & onion mixture in and toss well to coat! Transfer back to the serving bowl and chill for at least 15 minutes to let the flavors develop. This is a great time to stir-fry your chicken! Once you’re ready to serve, sprinkle liberally with sesame seeds and enjoy!

### BUTTERY SMASHED SUMMER SQUASH

### &nbsp;

### INGREDIENTS

&nbsp;

* 1 lb yellow/summer/crookneck squash
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* Water to cover
* 1 Tablespoon salted butter
* Optional: grated Parmesan or Romano cheese to taste, basil for garnish/flavor

&nbsp;

### INSTRUCTIONS

&nbsp;

1. Trim ends and stems of squash and cut into 1/2" pieces (~1cm).
2. Place into a small saucepan and cover with water. Add 1/2 teaspoon salt to water and bring to a boil over medium high heat for about 10 minutes, when a fork should very easily pierce the squash. Remove from heat and transfer to a strainer to remove all of the water.
3. Return to pan and add tablespoon of grass fed butter (I like Kerrygold salted!) and mash with a fork, potato masher, or stiff whisk until desired consistency is achieved.
4. Season to taste with salt, pepper, cheese, or fresh herbs!
