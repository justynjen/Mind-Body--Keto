IT’S FRIDAY - GET SMASHED! Smashed Summer squash, I mean, obvs... The gettin’ is SO GOOD RIGHT NOW at the farmer’s market. So dang good, I have been way overbuying, but I don’t know if you can REALLY overbuy beautiful, bright yellow summer squash when you can use THIS recipe and freeze it for yummy reminders of summertime whenever!

I love trading in my cauliflower mash for mashed yellow squash. Not only is it absolutely delicious, but perfect for low carb, paleo and keto eating with only 2.5 net grams of carbs per serving & chock full of beta carotene, lutein, and vitamin C. Being non-starchy, this also cooks SUPER fast, bringing an amazing side dish to your table in under 10 minutes.

Yes - there is a higher water content; no, the texture is not the same as potatoes or cauliflower, but TRUST ME - you're gonna love it...

Recipe type:&nbsp;

Cuisine:&nbsp;

Serves: 4 1/2 Cups&nbsp;

&nbsp;

### INGREDIENTS

&nbsp;

* 1 lb yellow/summer/crookneck squash
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* Water to cover
* 1 Tablespoon salted butter
* Optional: grated Parmesan or Romano cheese to taste, basil for garnish/flavor

&nbsp;

### INSTRUCTIONS

&nbsp;

1. Trim ends and stems of squash and cut into 1/2" pieces (~1cm).
2. Place into a small saucepan and cover with water. Add 1/2 teaspoon salt to water and bring to a boil over medium high heat for about 10 minutes, when a fork should very easily pierce the squash. Remove from heat and transfer to a strainer to remove all of the water.
3. Return to pan and add tablespoon of grass fed butter (I like Kerrygold salted!) and mash with a fork, potato masher, or stiff whisk until desired consistency is achieved.
4. Season to taste with salt, pepper, cheese, or fresh herbs!
