Honeys, I have loved a good party since I was knee-high to a grasshopper, and it only continued as gatherings of food and friends populated so much of my life. By the time I was fourteen and given the assignment of visualizing my life 10 years in the future, one of my goals was to become the consummate hostess. It’s really no wonder that I became a chef to make that former dream a total reality!

&nbsp;

Anyhow, when I was a little girl, there were two delicious salads that my mother would make that always signaled 1) It’s summer! and 2) We’re going to or throwing a PARTY! One was her signature potato salad, and the other was this ridiculously simple green bean salad. The only twist I have put on this recipe that I learned what seems like a zillion years ago is exchanging the more traditional cooking oils with MCT oil. I like the jolt of energy and boost into ketosis that it offers! You can read more about the benefits of MCT oil in my last post here.

&nbsp;

Putting it together is ridiculously easy, and the results are ridiculously delicious. Green beans, garlic, oil, salt and pepper and you will have a side dish that:

&nbsp;

* I have used to get children to love eating veggies
* Only gets better with time marinating
* Can be enjoyed hot or cold (I prefer it cold or room temperature myself)
* Is super low carb and keto-friendly, no matter what oil you use!

Once you try this simple salad, you are going to SEEK OUT green beans every chance you can to make it over and over again! Enjoy it at its most basic deliciousness, or add any combination of the optional ingredients to give it a flavor/texture boost.
