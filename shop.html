    <h2 class="cursive">Meet Chef Nicole</h2>
    <p>I’m Chef Nicole Poirier, and like you, I have faced my own health and weight loss struggles in this life. I know what it feels like to wake up every day asking “WHY? Why can’t I take control of my body and my weight when I can kick butt at life in so many other ways?!!”</p>
    <br/>
    <p>The good news is, I DID figure it out, and this is what inspired me to record my experiences, research the reasons everything seemed to magically fall into place so I could explain it scientifically, and create a way (or two!) to share it with YOU. Nobody should have to experience a daily battle with self-acceptance or feeling GOOD. So let’s DO THIS! More about the how in The MBK Difference.</p>
