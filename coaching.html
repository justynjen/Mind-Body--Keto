    <h2>Mind Body Keto Elite Coaching:</h2>
    <p>This is the most personal and interactive level of 1:1 coaching with Chef Nicole and is currently the most popular option among her clients. This gives you the opportunity to fully communicate where you are right now and have a restricted diets specialist tailor options to your needs, likes, and dislikes – no matter where you are in the world!</p>
    <br>
    <p>For some, that may be complete meal plans with recipes; for others, it may be a highly involved plan for eating out on the town for multiple meals per day. Chef Nicole’s clients have even brought her “virtual grocery shopping” over text to see if the choices they are making fit within healthy parameters!</p>
    <br>
    <p>The best part is – you will never feel alone or confused in your journey, and that can mean everything.</p>
