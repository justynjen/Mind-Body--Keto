On Sundays, I TOTALLY get the “brunchies”… You know, the uncontrollable desire to eat an even BETTER and more elaborated breakfast than normal and find a friend or two to share it with? You already KNOW my breakfast game is on point, but this keto chef always has a few tricks up her sleeve!

Today, as I’d invited a vegetarian/pescatarian pal to dine with me for a good old-fashioned catch-up, I replaced breakfast meats with some beautiful wild smoked salmon & cream cheese to be served on these ridiculicious (ridiculously delicious!) Herbed Keto Breadsticks that I dreamed up.

Paired with easy garlicky vegan hash and my fave sesame fried eggs, this brunch was SUCH a yummy feast!

Quick Herbed Keto Breadsticks

Makes 16 - 18 pieces, 4 - 5 per serving

INGREDIENTS&nbsp;

3/4 c almond flour

2 teaspoons baking powder

1 teaspoon Herbes de Provence blend

1/2 teaspoon onion powder

4 eggs

4 Tablespoons butter, ghee, or coconut oil, melted (I used salted butter)

1/8 teaspoon salt if not using salted butter

INSTRUCTIONS

Preheat oven to 375&ordm;F.

Combine dry ingredients in a bowl and whisk to blend well.

Add the eggs and butter and whisk again until the batter is smooth and there are no dry bits left.

Pour into a parchment-paper lined 8” x 8” baking dish. (I actually used an 8x12 tray because it’s what was on hand, and I like the thickness of the sticks. 8x8 will come out a bit more cornbread-style).

Bake for 15 - 20 minutes until the bottom is golden and the top is dry and begins to crack.

Remove from oven, cool for a couple of minutes, and cut into pieces. Enjoy! .
