## AWESOME THINGS THAT HAPPEN WHEN YOU GO KETO

Thinking about eating ketogenically but looking for some solid reasons to go keto? Here’s a quick list to tempt you, and this is only the tip of the iceberg!

### 1. YOU WILL LOSE WEIGHT.

If you have body fat that you want to lose, what makes more sense than turning it into fuel to run your magnificent body? Waste not, want not! Studies also show that ketogenic diets will lead to faster weight loss than many other traditional diets.

Most people see a SIGNIFICANT drop within the first couple of weeks when they go keto, when lowered insulin levels trigger the kidneys to release sodium. As sodium is let go, so is excess water, and you may find yourself running to the bathroom quite a bit in the early days! It is actually important to eat MORE salt during this time and supplement with other key electrolytes.


### 2. YOU WILL START TO BECOME MORE INSULIN-SENSITIVE.

Also, by restricting carbohydrates, as we said before, you will gain further control over your hormonal responses to food. The ketogenic diet has been proven repeatedly to help reverse insulin resistance, a condition in which the cells in your body stop responding normally to insulin (a hormone) trying to get in. This is one of the biggest hormonal hurdles to weight loss. If your body isn’t using your insulin efficiently, you will definitely gain weight.


### 3. YOUR SEX HORMONES MAY START TO BALANCE OUT, TOO.

Anecdotally, in the myriad of keto groups for women that I personally am in, sex hormones also get balanced, resulting in a LOT of “Keto Babies” as well as relief from menopausal symptoms! That’s right, if you have PCOS or have been having fertility issues, Keto may be the answer to your prayers.


### 4. YOU WILL STOP FEELING HUNGRY ALL THE TIME.

When you eat ketogenically, you will feel less hungry. Fat and protein have much higher satiety indices than carbohydrates. They burn more slowly in the body, leaving you feeling satisfied for longer!


### 5. YOUR BELLY WILL SHRINK.

Unhappy with the size of your tummy? Ketogenic diets accelerate fat loss from the belly area, acknowledged as one of the most heart-harmful places on the body to store fat.


### 6. GREAT SUCCESS HAS BEEN SHOWN IN REVERSING TYPE 2 DIABETES.

The reduction in blood sugars and over-production of insulin that I keep harping on about is a huge help in turning yourself around on the path to Type 2 Diabetes, if not reversing the disease itself. If you are already facing T2D, starting a ketogenic way of eating should be done with the cooperation of your physician, as it is very likely that your blood sugar control and insulin control medications will have to be altered periodically. Evidence has shown that in some cases, dosages need to be reduced after only ONE DAY of eating the low-carb-high-fat way!


### 7. YOUR BRAIN WILL BE SUPERCHARGED!

If you suffer from brain fog or an inability to focus, ketogenic diets may help boost your brainpower!. Initially, the ketogenic diet was designed to help treat brain & seizure disorders like epilepsy. While the mechanism as to why this works is still a bit of a mystery, proven scientific studies have illustrated how fatty acids (which are broken down into ketones) have all sorts of beneficial effects on the brain. WOOHOO!

These are just a sampling! Are there any questions or concerns that you can think of regarding any of these topics? Let me know in the comments!
