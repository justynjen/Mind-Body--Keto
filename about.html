    <p>I’m Chef Nicole Poirier, and like you, I have faced my own health and weight loss struggles in this life. I know what it feels like to wake up every day asking “WHY? Why can’t I take control of my body and my weight when I can kick butt at life in so many other ways?!!”</p>

    <p>The good news is, I DID figure it out, and this is what inspired me to record my experiences, research the reasons everything seemed to magically fall into place so I could explain it scientifically, and create a way (or two!) to share it with YOU. Nobody should have to experience a daily battle with self-acceptance or feeling GOOD. So let’s DO THIS! More about the how in The MBK Difference.</p>
    <br>
    <p>My backstory? I’ve been a professional chef for the past 17 years. It all began with a career as a chef on private yachts that took me all over the world, exposed me to all sorts of ingredients and cuisines, and introduced me to the niche of special diets as I was working with the world’s most affluent and informed people. All while in a tiny moving galley, always thinking on my feet!</p>
    <br>
    <p>With each new dietary requirement that was presented to me -  whether food allergy, medical condition, intolerance, or simply strong preference – I was inspired to take a look at the bigger picture, learn the ins and outs of each requirement, and craft a way to make my clients, guests, and crewmates healthier and happier with every bite. </p>
    <br>
    <p>A tenacious researcher, I explored the health benefits of each of the different ingredients I was using and my approach to nutrition became more and more holistic. All of the people I fed were thrilled and full of energy. It quickly became evident that special diets, mixed restrictions, and nutritional healing were my specialty and zone of genius. I transitioned to land cheffing, started a boutique catering service focusing on this, and business boomed because my heart and actions were aligned.</p>

    <h3>Healthy and delicious are not mutually exclusive.</h3>
    <br>
    <p>I am super passionate about what I do – I love finding ways to help people eat and live in ways that make their bodies SING. The form most of my career has been working with clients to throw dinner parties where every guest feels SAFE and NOURISHED, but it isn’t enough. I want to help MORE than one dinner party at a time. And so I turned the focus to 1:1 coaching, teaching, writing, and recipe & menu development.</p>

    <h3>All of this, of course, has both influenced and been influenced by my OWN health journey! </h3>
    <p>I battled the bulge most of my life, was formally diagnosed with a gluten allergy 10 years ago, and tried EVERYTHING to achieve my health & fitness goals, making healthier and healthier food and lifestyle choices every step of the way. TO NO AVAIL. Until September 2016.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I stumbled upon Keto, only a few steps apart from the gluten-free, mostly Paleo, all organic way I was already eating. After researching it for a few months, I started the ketogenic way of eating September 1st, 2016. A week later, I also happened to begin a ten-week meditation program. </p>

    <h3 class="cursive textCenter">And Magic Happened.</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Weight melted off.</li>
      <li>My energy skyrocketed.</li>
      <li>Productivity soared.</li>
      <li>Hormonal issues became a thing of the past and periods became regular without crippling PMS.</li>
      <li>I woke up happy and ready to greet each day.</li>
      <li>My attachment to food related habits disappeared.</li>
      <li>I ended each day and each job without debilitating back pain</li>
      <li>My mood balanced.</li>
      <li>I was able to handle formerly challenging situations with no sweat.</li>
      <li>Exercise became something I FELT like doing just because.</li>
      <li>Making myself and my own health and well-being became a priority without even forcing it</li>
      <li>Weirdly, business started taking off even MORE with more job offers and opportunities coming my way than ever before.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>In case you were wondering, I never looked back and decided to create ALL OF THIS HERE because honestly, I want as many people as I can possibly help get all of this awesomeness and more into their own lives, ASAP! </p>
