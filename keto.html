    <p>The magic of MBK lies in the aligning of mindset & physical body. When these two powerhouses are working together, there ain’t nothing you can’t do, as has now been repeatedly proven by my existing coaching clients!</p>
    <br>
    <p>The first step is commitment. I mean jumping off the side of the boat commitment. Once you take that slightly scary step, the rest is easy. Let go and know that this is going to work, and you are already opening your mind to change. You will be taking clear and simple dietary steps to make it easy for the body to follow, and the cycle will continue, bolstered by encouragement, inspiration, and real-life strategies from Chef Nicole herself if you hit any snags.</p>

    <h3>THE MOST IMPORTANT INGREDIENT IN THE RECIPE OF SUCCESS IS MINDSET.</h3>
    <br>
    <p>The reason that the mindset is SO important when it comes to changing your weight or your current health situation by changing how you eat is:</p>
    <br>
    <h3>FOOD IS HUGELY EMOTIONAL FOR MOST PEOPLE.</h3>
    <br>
    <p>It’s more than just a collection of ingredients packaged into a slice of apple pie – it’s the flavor of love baked by your grandmother on a holiday. It feeds heart hunger when you’re homesick, and can trigger the same endorphins as hugs when you’re lonely or stressed. High-glycemic carbohydrates activate the same parts of the brain as those lit up by drug addiction.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Mindfulness strategies help you regain control over the psychological aspects of food attachments, while the dietary shift to ketogenic eating supports the physiological changes. Together, the pleasure and craving centers of the brain are literally retrained.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The Mind Body Keto method is made even EASIER because all of the recipes, meal plans, and overall game plan have been designed by a chef who loves making eating amazing food simple! </p>

    <h3>END THE STRUGGLE. HEAL YOUR BODY.
ONE DELICIOUS MEAL AT A TIME.</h3>
